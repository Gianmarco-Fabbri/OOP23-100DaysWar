Initial Setup
	At the start of the game:
	• Both the player and the enemy start with 0 troops.
	• Both have 1000 coins in their bank accounts.

Game Structure

	The player can choose from a variety of actions during their turn, and each turn lasts for a few seconds in real time.

Actions Available

During their turn, the player can perform the following actions:

	1. Buy Soldiers:
	    Soldiers are offensive units that can move across the map and attack enemy troops or conquer cells.
	    Soldiers can be upgraded to become stronger, up to a maximum level of 3.

	2. Build Towers:
	    Towers are defensive units that remain stationary on the map and attack enemy troops within their range.
	    Players can build two types of towers:
	        • Basic Towers: Cost less and have limited strength.
	        • Advanced Towers: Cost more but have superior strength.
		Towers can be upgraded to a maximum level of 3.

	3. Upgrade Units:
	        Both soldiers and towers can be upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness.
	        Upgrading units requires coins, and higher levels provide better stats.

	4. Move Soldiers:
	        Soldiers can be moved across the map.
	        If a soldier moves to a cell occupied by an enemy unit, a battle is triggered.

	    The number of dice rolled is proportional to the level of the soldiers involved.
	    The unit with the highest total score wins the battle and the defeated is destroyed.
